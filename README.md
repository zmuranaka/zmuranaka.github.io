# My Portfolio

## What is this Project?

This is my GitHub pages portfolio, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is hosted at [zmuranaka.github.io](https://zmuranaka.github.io).

## Directories:

images  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the social media logos, arrow images, burger nav icons, and video posters.  
scripts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the JavaScript that handles everything from how elements are displayed to how the smooth scroll functions.  
styles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the stylesheet for the website.  
videos  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder contains the videos showcasing my projects.

## Sources:

I got the GitHub logo from [GitHub](https://github.com/logos), I got the Handshake logo from
[Handshake](https://weber.joinhandshake.com), and I created the arrow images, burger nav icons, and mail logo in Adobe Photoshop.  
Sources that helped me create the project:  
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/keyframe-animation-syntax/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS-Tricks was very helpful for anything CSS-related, whether checking syntax or learning something new. For example, the webpage I linked taught me how keyframes work in CSS.  
https://www.w3schools.com/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W3Schools was very helpful when I was checking that my syntax was correct and as a general reference.
